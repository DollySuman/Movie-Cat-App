If your goal is to learn and strengthen fundamentals:

âœ… Start with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS first.

Build a simple frontend-only version that fetches movie data from the TMDB/OMDB API and displays it.

No backend, no database â€” just:

A search bar

Movie cards

Favorite list stored in localStorage

ðŸ§  Youâ€™ll solidify:

API calls (using fetch)

DOM manipulation

Layout design

LocalStorage use

Once this is working â†’ move to React + Tailwind.

âš¡ If your goal is to become confident in full-stack dev quickly:

âœ… Start directly with React + Tailwind.

Since youâ€™ve already done a full-stack course, youâ€™ll get more out of practicing component-based design and API handling in React.

Tailwind will speed up your UI work.

ðŸ§  Youâ€™ll strengthen:

React state & props

API integration

Component reuse

Styling workflow (Tailwind)

Future scalability for backend integration

ðŸ’¬ My suggestion for you:

Since youâ€™ve already watched a full-stack course, skip the plain HTML-CSS stage â€”
ðŸ‘‰ start directly with React + Tailwind, but keep it frontend-only at first (no backend).
Once thatâ€™s running, you can add your Node/Express + MongoDB backend later for login and favorites.
