Perfect — you’ve just built a working movie search app that fetches live data from an API 🎬🔥

Now the next step depends on what you want to learn or improve from this project.
Here are your best next moves (choose one direction 👇):

🧠 1. Frontend Improvement (Visuals)

Make your app look polished:

Add CSS for a movie grid layout (display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));)

Add hover animation on cards (transform: scale(1.05);)

Add a loading spinner ("Loading...") while fetch runs.

Show an error message if no results are found.

⚙️ 2. Code Optimization

Add a debounce so API doesn’t call on every keystroke instantly.

Use async/await instead of .then() for cleaner async code.

Add a “Clear Results” button.

🧩 3. Learning API Integration Properly

If your goal is to learn APIs, next steps are:

Understand the API structure (GET, params, response format).

Try adding another free movie API (like OMDb API or TMDB).

Combine both APIs to show extra info — rating, genre, release year.

💾 4. Save Favorites (Add Logic)

Add features like:

“❤️ Add to Favorites” button

Save favorites to localStorage

Display a “My Favorites” section

🌐 5. Host it Online

Deploy your mini app:

Push to GitHub

Host using Netlify or Vercel (free, 1-click deploy)
